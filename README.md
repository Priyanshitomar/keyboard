Objectives
 The primary objectives of this internship were to:
1.	Gain practical exposure to AI/ML applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
2.	Design and implement an intelligent autocorrect keyboard using predictive models.
3.	Enhance programming and problem-solving skills by working on N-grams and RNNs.
4.	Apply classroom learning in a real-world project environment.
Tasks and Responsibilities
 During my internship, I contributed to the following tasks:
Project Development:
•	Designed an autocorrect keyboard application capable of predicting the next word using contextual input.
•	Implemented an N-gram based prediction model (bigram) to learn word sequences and suggest likely next words.
•	Experimented with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to improve contextual accuracy.
Programming & Tools:
•	Developed the GUI interface using Tkinter in Python for real-time predictions.
•	Used Python libraries and data structures to train models and process text efficiently.
Testing & Optimization:
•	Conducted multiple test runs to evaluate the accuracy of predictions.
•	Tuned parameters to reduce incorrect suggestions and improve user experience.
Collaboration:
•	Reported progress regularly to the mentor and discussed challenges/solutions.
Learning Outcomes
•	Technical Skills: Gained proficiency in NLP, N-gram models, GUI development, and Python programming.
•	Practical Application: Learned how to integrate ML models into a working application.
•	Problem-Solving: Improved debugging, optimization, and testing skills.
•	Professional Growth: Understood how to manage project timelines, adapt to feedback, and document progress effectively.
Challenges and Solutions
Challenge 1: Handling low accuracy in predictions with limited training data.
•	Solution: Expanded the training corpus and implemented randomization to generate varied outputs.
Challenge 2: Designing a user-friendly interface for the keyboard.
•	Solution: Built an interactive Tkinter GUI that allows real-time input and displays predictions clearly.
Challenge 3: Transitioning from simple N-grams to more advanced models.
•	Solution: Experimented with RNNs for better contextual predictions, improving model reliability.
Conclusion
My internship at ShadowFox was an invaluable experience that helped me transition from academic learning to practical application in AI and NLP. Developing an autocorrect keyboard gave me hands-on exposure to language models, GUI design, and project deployment. This opportunity enhanced my confidence, strengthened my technical expertise, and fueled my aspiration to pursue AI-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.
